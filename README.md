# JS-learning — Starter

Quick start and learning roadmap for JavaScript and Node.js.

Getting started
- Rebuild the devcontainer in VS Code: Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container".
- Open a terminal in the container and verify:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Run the starter app

```bash
npm start
```

Roadmap (recommended sequence)
- Basics: variables, types, control flow, functions
- Data structures: arrays, objects, maps, sets
- Asynchronous JS: callbacks, Promises, async/await
- Node.js: modules, `npm`, file system, streams
- Web: DOM, events, fetch/API calls
- Tooling: ESLint, Prettier, testing (Jest), bundlers
- Frameworks: React / Vue / Svelte, and backend with Express

Suggested exercises
- Build a CLI script that reads/writes files
- Create a small HTTP server with Express
- Fetch data from a public API and display results

If you want, I can add exercises with automated tests or expand any topic.
